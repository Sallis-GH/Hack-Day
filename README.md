# Poke-app

<p> A one day project I did while studying at &lt;/Salt&gt; </p>

---
  
### How to run
  
  Npm install on both client and server folder, <br>
  then do npm start on the same files. <br>
  Once you do npm start on the client folder it should open
  up the application. <br>
  
  <p> If it doesn't automatically open up you can access it <a href="http://localhost:5000/">localhost:5000<a></p>
