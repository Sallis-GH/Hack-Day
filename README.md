# Poke-app

<p> A one day project I did while studying at &lt;Salt&gt; </p>

---
  
### How to run
  
  Npm install on both client and server folder
  then do npm start on the same files.
  Once you do npm start on the client folder it should open
  up the application.
  
  If it doesn't automatically open up you can access it on http://localhost:5000/
